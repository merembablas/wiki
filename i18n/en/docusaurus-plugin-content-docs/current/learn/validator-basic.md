Validators in the Nuchain network are computers that are connected to each other in a distributed and publicly owned manner with the aim of powering and securing the Nuchain network.
 
The Nuchain network does not use the concept of [PoW](../general/glossary.md#pow) but uses the concept of [PoS](../general/glossary.md#pos) to secure the network. [PoS](../general/glossary.md#pos) makes Nuchain environmentally friendly because it doesn't need a computer with heavy performance.

Anyone can contribute to securing the Nuchain network by becoming a validator, and in return the contributor will receive [ARA](../general/glossary.md#ara) tokens.

:::info

The PoS (Proof of Stake) concept requires a token to become a validator. If you don't have a token yet, please join the [Faucet](../general/faucet.md) program.
