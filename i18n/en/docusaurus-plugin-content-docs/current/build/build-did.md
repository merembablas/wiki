Nuchain supports DIDs and use it as a base for controlling objects' access and otorization 


## What is Decentralized ID?

DIDs is a decentralized mechanism to manage ID and otorization. DIDs is _powerful_ since it allows you to access services without the need of giving away your personal data to third party applicator. 

DIDs functions for _runtime_ can be found at
[modul DIDs](https://github.com/nusantarachain/nuchain/tree/develop/frame/did).

DIDs implementation follows specification from [W3C] (https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)
