Nuchain supports development of on-chain application, called _smart contract_. 

At the moment, Nuchain has a native fiture for creating app based on:

- DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)
- Organization
- DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).
- Supply Chain.
- Digital Certificate Platform.
- NFT (Non Fungible Token).

All required functions are easily accessed using [Extrinsic](../learn/learn-extrinsic.md)

## Development

Utilising network in Nuchain to create application are possible in two means. 

The first one is by utilising [_smart contract_](../general/glossary.md#kontrak-pintar). You can build [DApps](../general/glossary.md#dapps) on Nuchain network. Examples of code for [DApps](../general/glossary.md#dapps) can be found at [onchain-apps](https://github.com/nusantarachain/onchain-apps). 

The second one is by creating module on _runtime_. This way is applicable especially for special cases that can not utilise [_smart contract_](../general/glossary.md#kontrak-pintar). However, you should pay attention that any change made in runtime should meet special criteria and requirements. The changes that has been made is _global_, therefore, you need to _upgrade_ the system. 



## Testnet

You can use [network](network.md) for easier development processes. 
[Testnet](../general/glossary.md#testnet). The Testnet network of Nuchain is accessed by visiting [dashboard](https://dashboard.nuchain.network). The steps are:
1. Visit web app [dashboard](https://dashboard.nuchain.network).
2. Change the network by clicking Nuchain logo at top-left corner of your screen. In the "LIVE NETWORKS" choose menu "Nuchain Testnet" _hosted by Rantai Nusantara_.
